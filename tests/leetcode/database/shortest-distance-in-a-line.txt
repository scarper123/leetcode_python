Simple Solution
    SELECT wt1.Id 
    FROM Weather wt1, Weather wt2
    WHERE wt1.Temperature > wt2.Temperature AND 
          TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)-TO_DAYS(wt2.DATE)=1;


EXPLANATION:

**TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)** return the number of days between from year 0 to date DATE
**TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)-TO_DAYS(wt2.DATE)=1** check if wt2.DATE is yesterday respect to wt1.DATE

We select from the joined tables the rows that have 

**wt1.Temperature > wt2.Temperature** 

and difference between dates in days of 1 (yesterday):

**TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)-TO_DAYS(wt2.DATE)=1;**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My simple solution using inner join
    SELECT t1.Id
    FROM Weather t1
    INNER JOIN Weather t2
    ON TO_DAYS(t1.Date) = TO_DAYS(t2.Date) + 1
    WHERE t1.Temperature > t2.Temperatur

Two Solutions..........
1.

    SELECT a.Id FROM Weather AS a, Weather AS b
    WHERE DATEDIFF(a.Date, b.Date)=1 AND a.Temperature > b.Temperature

2.

    SELECT Id FROM (
        SELECT CASE
            WHEN Temperature > @prevtemp AND DATEDIFF(Date, @prevdate) = 1 THEN Id ELSE NULL END AS Id,
            @prevtemp:=Temperature,
            @prevdate:=Date
        FROM Weather, (SELECT @prevtemp:=NULL) AS A, (SELECT @prevdate:=NULL) AS B ORDER BY Date ASC
    ) AS D WHERE Id IS NOT NULL

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My simple solution
select w1.id 
from Weather w1, Weather w2 
where (DATEDIFF(w1.Date, w2.Date) = 1) AND w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is subtracting 1 directly from Date not working, but subdate(a.Date,1) works?
Why is subtracting 1 directly from Date not working, but subdate(a.Date,1) works?

My code is 

    select W1.Id
    from Weather as W1, Weather as W2
    where W1.Date-1 = W2.Date and W1.Temperature> W2.Temperature

it only passed 13/14 cases.

However, when I changed `W1.Date-1` to `sub(W1.Date,1)` in the where clause, it worked. What is fundamental difference?


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple straightforward solution and it&#x27;s very fast
    select w1.Id Id from Weather w1, Weather w2 where datediff(w1.Date,w2.Date)=1 and w1.Temperature>w2.Temperature

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My first SQL query
select a.Id as Id
        from 
        Weather as a
        join
        Weather as b
        ON
        b.Date = subdate(a.Date,1)
        where 
        a.Temperature > b.Temperature;

Solution with mysql built-in function
    SELECT 
        t1.Id
    From 
        Weather t1, Weather t2
    WHERE 
        t1.Temperature > t2.Temperature
    AND
        subdate(t1.Date, 1) = t2.Date

MySQL SUBDATE() subtracts a time value (as interval) from a given date.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A solusion with time 1025 ms
    select a.Id from (select w2.Id from Weather w1 join Weather w2 on datediff(w2.Date,w1.Date)=1 where w1.Temperature < w2.Temperature) a

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why using a condition on Id not working?

    SELECT a.Id FROM Weather a INNER JOIN Weather b ON a.Id=b.Id+1
     WHERE a.Temperature>b.Temperature

I know the logic here is all about one day earlier, but the code I write should have given the same answer. However, it was not working here. Why?
