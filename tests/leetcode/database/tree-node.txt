Three accpeted solutions
    SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary 
    FROM
    	Employee E,
    	(SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId) T,
    	Department D
    WHERE E.DepartmentId = T.DepartmentId 
      AND E.Salary = T.max
      AND E.DepartmentId = D.id

    SELECT D.Name,A.Name,A.Salary 
    FROM 
    	Employee A,
    	Department D   
    WHERE A.DepartmentId = D.Id 
      AND NOT EXISTS 
      (SELECT 1 FROM Employee B WHERE B.Salary > A.Salary AND A.DepartmentId = B.DepartmentId) 

    SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary

Simple solution, easy to understand
    SELECT dep.Name as Department, emp.Name as Employee, emp.Salary 
    from Department dep, Employee emp 
    where emp.DepartmentId=dep.Id 
    and emp.Salary=(Select max(Salary) from Employee e2 where e2.DepartmentId=dep.Id)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sharing my simple solution
    Select Department.Name, emp1.Name, emp1.Salary from 
    Employee emp1 join Department on emp1.DepartmentId = Department.Id
    where emp1.Salary = (Select Max(Salary) from Employee emp2 where emp2.DepartmentId = emp1.DepartmentId); 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GROUP BY HAVING not working for multiple highest salary, why?
`SELECT b.Name as Department, a.Name as Employee, a.Salary
FROM Employee a
JOIN Department b
ON a.DepartmentId = b.Id
GROUP BY Department
HAVING a.Salary = max(a.Salary)`

This way it was not able to return multiple rows with same highest salary. I can't figure why, please help!

Share my simple query using &gt;= ALL
<PRE><CODE>
select Department.Name as Department, e1.Name as Employee, Salary
from Employee e1, Department
where e1.DepartmentId = Department.Id 
and
Salary >= ALL (select Salary from Employee e2 where e2.DepartmentId = e1.DepartmentId);
</CODE></PRE>

Easy Solution. No joins. GROUP BY is enough. 916ms
    select
    d.Name, e.Name, e.Salary
    from
    Department d,
    Employee e,
    (select MAX(Salary) as Salary,  DepartmentId as DepartmentId from Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId) h
    where
    e.Salary = h.Salary and
    e.DepartmentId = h.DepartmentId and
    e.DepartmentId = d.Id;

Why cannot we just use max() with group by?
    select D.name as Department, E.name as Employee, max(salary) as Salary 
        from Employee E , Department D 
        where E.DepartmentId = D.Id  
        group by D.id

I tried to use something like this, but it did not pass. When two departments has the same max salary, it only outputs one row.

However, this is not how it works in my local mysql.

Why is this wrong?

A simple solution use one join
select d.Name Department, e.Name Employee, Salary
from Department d join Employee e on d.Id=e.DepartmentId
where (Salary,d.id) in (select max(Salary),DepartmentId from Employee group by DepartmentId);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accepted Solution without using Max() function
    select b.Name Department, a.Name Employee, a.Salary from
    (
        select a.Name, a.Salary, a.DepartmentId 
        from Employee a left outer join Employee b
        on a.DepartmentId = b.DepartmentId 
        and a.Salary < b.Salary
        where b.Id is null
    ) a join Department b
    on a.DepartmentId = b.Id;
