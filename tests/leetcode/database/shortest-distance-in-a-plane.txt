Simple Solution
> DELETE p1  
FROM Person p1, Person p2  
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND
>               p1.Id > p2.Id

EXPLANATION:

 - Take the table in the example
 
**Id | Email**

**1 | john@example.com** 

**2 | bob@example.com** 

**3 | john@example.com**

 - Join the table on itself by the Email and you'll get:

> FROM Person p1, Person p2  WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email

**p1.Id  | p1.Email | p2.Id | p2.Email**

**1	| john@example.com	| 1	| john@example.com**

**3	| john@example.com      | 1	| john@example.com**

**2	| bob@example.com	| 2	| bob@example.com**

**1	| john@example.com	| 3	| john@example.com**

**3	| john@example.com	| 3	| john@example.com**

 - From this results filter the records that have p1.Id>p2.ID, in this case you'll get just one record:

> AND           p1.Id > p2.Id

**p1.Id  | p1.Email | p2.Id | p2.Email**

**3	| john@example.com	| 1	| john@example.com**

 - This is the record we need to delete, and by saying

> DELETE p1

in this multiple-table syntax, only matching rows from the tables listed before the FROM clause are deleted, in this case just

**p1.Id  | p1.Email**

**3	| john@example.com**

will be deleted

A skillful mysql solution  avoid &quot; select and update conflict&quot;
**where we try this clause :**

    delete from Person where id not in(select min(id) as id from Person group by email)

you will be noted " **You can't specify target table 'Person' for update in FROM clause** ",
The solution is using a middle table with select clause:

    delete from Person where id not in( 
        select t.id from (
            select min(id) as id from Person group by email
        ) t
    )

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution in a Single query without any conflicts
    DELETE p from Person p, Person q where p.Id>q.Id AND q.Email=p.Email 

will keep the minimum id field

I can&#x27;t believe I get it wrong! What&#x27;s wrong with my code?
select email,min(id) from Person group by email

This is very simple sql right? How's possible it return duplicate emails?

My answer to Delete Duplicate Emails with double nested query.

    as Cid) ;

Very easy to understand
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
DELETE p2 FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2. Email AND p1.Id < p2.Id

I run the solution in Mysql and get the result expected
delete from Person where id not in (select id from (select min(id) as id from Person group by email) as a);


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this does not work?
Select min(Id) as Id, Email
from Person
group by Email

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is wrong with this simple syntax?
	SELECT MIN(id), Email
	FROM Person
	GROUP BY Email;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this solution get &#x27;runtime error&#x27;

    delete from Person where Id not in (select min(Id) from Person group by Email)







----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is wrong with this query?
    delete from person where id not in (select min(id), email from person group by email);

An Intuitive Solution
    delete from Person
    where Id not in
    (select mid from (select min(Id) as mid from Person
    group by Email)T )


It works perfectly.

Due to some MySQL specific reason I have to nest one more level to select mid, otherwise it will prompt an error. I'd appreciate it if someone happens to know why.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this solution get &quot;wrong answer&quot;
My solution is :
SELECT MIN(Id) as Id,Email FROM Person GROUP BY Email;
Why does't it work?
