My first accepted SQL solution, using GROUP BY in 845 ms, thank God...
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    select email 
    from( 
         select 
               email, 
               count(*) as c
         from Person
         group by email
    ) a
    where a.c > 1;
We should review and think over other guys' solution frequently, especially for beginners. I think it's significantly helpful~~

My solution_____
    SELECT Email FROM Person
    GROUP BY Email
    HAVING COUNT(Email) > 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard solution with distinct
    SELECT DISTINCT Person.Email 
    FROM Person 
    GROUP BY Person.Email
    HAVING COUNT(Person.Email) > 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple solution (Not bad)
    select distinct(p.Email) 
    from Person p, Person p1
    where (p.Id <> p1.Id and p.Email = p1.Email);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Min() and max(), a different way to find duplicate
Just for sharing. It can also find the `duplicate` emails.

    SELECT email 
    FROM (  SELECT email, MIN(id) minid, MAX(id) maxid
            FROM Person 
            GROUP by email ) minmax
    WHERE minid <> maxid
If change the where condition, we can get the `unique` ones.

    WHERE minid = maxid

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This should work but dosent :c
select Email from 
    (select Email, count(*) over (partition by Email) c from Person)
where c>1

Ive tried everything google tells me to do..i cant seem to make it work

888ms solution, any faster solution?
select Email from Person group by Email having count(Email) > 1;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
892ms group by solution
    SELECT Email
    FROM (SELECT Email, COUNT(Email) AS numOfEmail
        FROM Person
        GROUP BY Email) AS T1 
    WHERE T1.numOfEmail > 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using &quot;group by&quot; and &quot;having&quot;
select Email
from Person
group by Email
having count(Email) > 1;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a newbie on SQL,share my solution(no &quot;having&quot;,no &quot;JOIN&quot;)
SELECT CountTable.Email FROM (
SELECT Person.Email,COUNT(Person.Email) AS CountNum
	FROM Person
	GROUP BY Person.Email
) AS CountTable WHERE CountTable.CountNum>1;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the #1 solution:what if there are more than two duplicates?
If the number of each duplicate are more than two, for example, there are three records having the same Email address, will the output table have duplicates in it?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is wrong with my solution ?
    SELECT DISTINCT P1.Email 
    FROM Person P1
    WHERE (SELECT COUNT(P1.Email) FROM Person) > 1;

I hope to only include email of those persons for which count is greater than one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sharing my solution
    select Email from
    (select Email, count(*) as count from person
    group by email
    having count > 1) as emailcount;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What&#x27;s wrong with my solution? (without group by)
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Email FROM Person
HAVING (COUNT(Email)>1);



Without GROUP BY Email, I alway got wrong answer. What is GROUP BY, why it matters here?
